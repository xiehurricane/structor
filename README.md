#### What Structor is:
* **Structor is a visual editor (WYSIWYG editor)** - you may construct a React component of any complexity combining components and styling them right on the page.
* **Structor is a scaffolding tool** - you may generate scaffolds of different types of React components (dumbs, containers) with different configuration.
* **Structor is a library tool** - you may find many full-fledged components which can be installed into your project from Structor Market.
* **Structor is a playground tool** - you may modify the source code and have an instant feedback immediately because of embedded Hot Reloading tools.    

#### What Structor is not:

* Structor is not a graphical Web design tool.
* Structor is not a Web site/Web app/Web pages generator tool.
* Structor does not modify the source code of your project.

### Getting started

Beginning from version 2 Structor should be installed as a local npm module into `react-boilerplate` project. 

As far as Structor uses a custom metadata in order to operate the project's components, there is a fork of `react-boilerplate` project genuinely prepared for Structor.
      
Please find the instruction of how to install and start working with Structor in compatible fork of the `react-boilerplate` project here: [https://github.com/ipselon/react-boilerplate](https://github.com/ipselon/react-boilerplate);
